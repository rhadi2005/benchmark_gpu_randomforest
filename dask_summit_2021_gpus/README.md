# Using Dask and many GPUs to train a neural network with PyTorch

This is the code supporting the 2021 Dask Summit talk on using many GPUs to train a neural network to generate pet names.
The entire code base is stored in a single Jupyter notebook, including connections to Weights & Biases.

To use the notebook, we recommend running the code in Saturn Cloud, however it should be able to work anywhere with only very minor adjustments.
You will also need to create a separate login and project for Weights & Biases to use that component.
